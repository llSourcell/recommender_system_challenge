#CHALLENGE part 1 of 3 - write your own fetch and format method for a different recommendation
#dataset. Here a good few https://gist.github.com/entaroadun/1653794 
#And take a look at the fetch_movielens method to see what it's doing 
#

#fetch data and format it
data = fetch_movielens( min_rating=4.0)

#print training and testing data
print(repr(data['train']))
print(repr(data['test']))


#CHALLENGE part 2 of 3 - use 3 different loss functions (so 3 different models), compare results, print results for
#the best one. - Available loss functions are warp, logistic, bpr, and warp-kos.

#create model
model = LightFM(loss='warp')
#train model
model.fit(data['train'], epochs=30, num_threads=2)


#CHALLENGE part 3 of 3 - Modify this function so that it parses your dataset correctly to retrieve
#the necessary variables (products, songs, tv shows, etc.)
#then print out the recommended results
